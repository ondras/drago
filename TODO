Other files:
! * .TOW - about the real estate inventory
! * .PIT - almost all zeros
! * .CAR - strange names; cities but also Fuckopolis
  * .EDT - full of German chains
  * .CVC - 256 (16x16?) quads [255,255,255,0]

What remains to be solved (they are not necessary!):
  * .001 - apparently a byte pair; there are 1716 of them; not much visually
  * .C88 - apparently a byte pair; there are 7072 of them
  * .OIT - 16x8 byte blocks; there are 80 of them
  * .EIT - apparently four bytes, they are increasing
