			<h1>Drago &ndash; Help</h1>
			<p>This game is a browser-based re-creation of Blue Byte Software's 1997 hit 
			<em>Dr. Drago's Madcap Chase</em> (or <em>Die total verrückte Rallye</em> in Germany). 
			While the main gameplay principles remain the same, there is a number of smaller and larger differences 
			between the original game and this version.</p>
			
			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>In Drago, several players compete against each other, trying to earn the largest amount of money. Up to eight human players can participate; 
			the gameplay is hotseat-based.</p>
			<p>Money is won primarily by winning races (for winning a race, you earn $100.000), 
			although there are additional ways to get richer (or poorer). The game never ends; as soon as a race is finished, new destination is 
			picked and a new race starts.</p>
			
			<h2>Implementation status</h2>
			<p>A large portion of the original game is completed. The following features are missing, either by design or because of lack of time:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The whole Real estate aspect of the game</li>
				<li>Dr. Drago</li>
				<li>Bots / AI</li>
				<li>Several cards</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At any time, the whole game map can be inspected by dragging it with mouse.</p>
			
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p>Drago can be played using a keyboard, a mouse or a touch device. A reasonably modern web browser is also necessary ☺</p>
			<p>Players take turns moving their vehicles across Europe in order to get first to a target capital city. Once the city is reached, 
			the race is completed and the winner receives $100.000. A new destination is immediately automatically picked and the game continues.</p>
			
			<p>During one turn, a player can use a <em>slot machine</em> (game equivalent of a throwing dice) or <em>play a card</em> (if he or she has one). 
			These are used to increase available <em>movement points</em> and advance towards the target destination.</p>
			<p>Once a nonzero amount of moves is available, player can start driving (arrow keys, arrow icons next to player's portrait) in arbitrary direction. 
			It is possible to travel backwards and change directions as requested, but the player must spend all his/her moves in order to end the turn. The arrow images show the shortest path towards the current target town.</p>
			<p>When there are no moves remaining, player's position must be confirmed (Enter or click/touch the player). The turn's outcome is based on the 
			color of the square at player's position.</p>
			
			<h2>Squares</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Blue square: a random amount of money is won!</li>
				<li>Red square: a random amount of money is lost!</li>
				<li>Yellow square: player gets a random card!</li>
				<li>Purple square: player can buy and sell cards.</li>
				<li>Gray/White square: a town. Nothing happens in towns for now.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>During a turn, players also pass through red round markers. These serve educational purposes, as pressing Enter on them opens a box with 
			local historical/architectural information.</p>
			
			<h2>Cards</h2>
			<p>A player can own up to eight cards. Using a card often results in skipping the slot machine; movement points are gained from the card. 
			The following list shows all available card types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2..5 reels: improved versions of the slot machine for more movement points</li>
				<li>1..6 spaces: gain the given amount of movement points</li>
			</ul>
